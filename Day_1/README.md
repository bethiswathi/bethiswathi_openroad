| **Component**                     | **Description**                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Applications (Apps)**           | User-level programs that perform specific tasks or functions.                                                   |
| **System Software**               | Acts as a bridge between hardware and applications, managing system resources and providing essential services. |
| **Operating System (OS)**         | Core system software that controls hardware, memory, files, and processes (e.g., Windows, Linux, Android).      |
| **Compiler**                      | Translates high-level programming code (C, C++, Java) into assembly language.                                   |
| **Assembler**                     | Converts assembly language code into machine (binary) code executable by the processor.                         |
| **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** | Describes digital circuit behavior in terms of registers and data transfers.                                    |
| **Hardware**                      | Physical electronic components that execute instructions and perform computations.                              |
