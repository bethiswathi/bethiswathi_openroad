### 🧩 What Are RTL IPs?

- **RTL IPs (Register Transfer Level Intellectual Properties)** are **pre-designed and pre-verified digital logic blocks**, described at the **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** using **Verilog** or **VHDL**.
- They can be **reused** in different chip designs to save development time and effort.

### ⚙️ Purpose of RTL IPs

- To **speed up chip design** by reusing verified modules instead of creating everything from scratch.
- To **ensure reliability**, since verified IPs have already been tested.
- To **standardize** digital designs using reusable building blocks.

### 🧠 Benefits of Using RTL IPs
| **Benefit**                | **Explanation**                                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Reusability**            | One verified IP can be used in multiple projects.                                     |
| **Reduced Time-to-Market** | Designers can focus on system-level design rather than reimplementing common modules. |
| **Reliability**            | IPs are pre-verified and proven in silicon.                                           |
| **Customization**          | Many IPs are parameterized (configurable width, depth, protocol version, etc.).       |
| **Cost Efficiency**        | Reduces design, testing, and verification costs.                                      |

### 🧩 What Is PDK Data?

- **PDK (Process Design Kit) data** refers to all the **information, files, and models** provided by a **semiconductor foundry** that describe **how to design and fabricate ICs (chips)** using their specific process technology (like 130 nm, 65 nm, etc.).
- It acts as a bridge between the design team (who make the chip layout) and the foundry (who manufacture the chip).


### ⚙️ Purpose of PDK Data

- To ensure your design **follows the physical, electrical, and timing rules** of a given process.
- To let **EDA tools** (like Magic, OpenROAD, Yosys) accurately **simulate, verify, and layout** the chip.
- To provide **models** for transistors, interconnects, and devices used in circuit design.

### 🧠 Why PDK Data Is Important
| **Reason**            | **Explanation**                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accuracy**          | Ensures simulations reflect real silicon behavior.            |
| **Manufacturability** | Guarantees your layout follows all physical rules.            |

- To simulate and verify **functionality, timing, and layout**.
- To prepare the final **GDSII** file for fabrication.

### 🧠 Why EDA Tools Are Important
| **Reason**       | **Explanation**                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automation**   | Handle millions of transistors efficiently.         |
| **Accuracy**     | Provide realistic simulation and layout validation. |
| **Optimization** | Improve area, power, and performance.               |
| **Verification** | Ensure the chip works correctly before fabrication. |
| **Productivity** | Greatly reduce design time and human error.         |

### 🧰 Popular Open-Source EDA Toolchain Example

## Design Folder Hierarchy :
- In each design hierarchy, you will find two distinct components:

- **Src Folder**: This directory contains Verilog files (.v) and SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) files (.sdc). Verilog files describe the digital logic of your design, while SDC files specify timing constraints for your design.

- **Config.tcl Files**: These are design-specific configuration files used by OpenLANE. They include switches and settings that tailor the ASIC design flow for your specific project.


## Inception of Open Source EDA

### Skywater PDK Files
- The Skywater PDK files we are working with are described under $PDK_ROOT. There are three subdirectories needed.



1. Skywater-pdk – Contains all the foundry provided PDK related files
2. Open_pdks – Contains scripts that are used to bridge the gap between closed-source and open-source PDK to EDA tool compatibility
3. Sky130A – Open-source-compatible PDK files for Skywater, designed to work with open-source EDA tools for ASIC development without proprietary dependencies.


### Pre-requisites
- First make sure you have the basic tools and packages
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-pip \
     git wget curl make automake gcc g++ bison flex libreadline-dev \
     gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev graphviz xdot pkg-config libboost-system-dev \
     libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev

```
### Install Docker (recommended way to run OpenLane)
OpenLane uses Docker to ensure a consistent environment



## Invoking OpenLane



- /flow.tcl is the script which runs the OpenLANE flow
- OpenLANE can be run interactively or in autonomous mode
- To run interactively, use the -interactive option with the ./flow.tcl script
